    <h1>Greek cuisine!</h1>
    <p>Greek cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine and therefore has many similarities with Italian and Spanish cuisine. However, it is also heavily influenced by Turkish cuisine â€“ they share foods such as baklava, tzatziki, dolmades and yuvarlakia.</p>
    <p>Although Greece is a small country, each region in the past had quite different types of food production which throughout the years resulted in a very diverse cuisine. The culture, though, is the same! Food plays an important role in socializing with others, in sharing moments with family and friends over wine, ouzo, rakh, or rakomelo drinks. It is quite common to see on a table lots of mezedes or orektika together (appetizers).</p>
