    <p> South Asia has almost a population of 2 billion people, made up of different ethnicities, languages and religions. South Asian food as a result is very diverse but with many common herbs and spices used in most of the dishes. Reflecting the diversity of the continent, there are many different street foods and variations of the same street foods. Here are some of the most common and some of my favourite street food dishes. </p>

      <p> Chai (tea) is one of the most common drinks in South Asian culture. There are many different types of Chai belonging to different areas of the continent. Kashmiri Chai (also known as Pink Tea or Noon Chai) is the most common Chai in the Kashmir region. Kashmiri Chai is made from a rich blend of spices, sugar, salt, milk and pistachios. </p>

      <p> Samosa Chaat is a combination of two common snacks with the addition of extra sauce; Samosas and chaat. This dish has variaitons but it is usually the layering of a Samosa, chickpeas in a creamy sauce, yogurt, tamarind sauce, and various garnishings. The rich blend of flavours come together to make a tantalising snack or starter.  </p>

      <p> Masala Fish is fish, usually tillapia, marinated in a spicy sauce and fried to perfection. Masala Fish makes a tasty starter on it's own or can be a main with a side of Naan. It can even be turned into a burger! </p>
